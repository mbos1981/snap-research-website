    In our work titled “<a class="can-line-break" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05801.pdf">Linkless Link Prediction via Relational Distillation</a>,” 
    accepted at <a class="can-line-break" href="https://icml.cc/">ICML 2023</a>,
    we propose a novel approach that leverages cross-model distillation techniques from GNNs to
    MLPs. This enables us to take advantage of the performance benefits of GNNs and the speed
    benefits of MLPs for link prediction tasks. We began by exploring two direct distillation methods,
    namely logit-based and representation-based matching. However, we observed that these
    methods were ineffective for link prediction tasks, which we hypothesized was due to their
    inability to capture relational knowledge which is critical to the link prediction task. To address
    this limitation, we introduce a relational distillation framework called Linkless Link Prediction
    (LLP), which focuses on matching the relationships between each node and other nodes in the
    graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LLP consistently outperforms MLPs and the
    two direct distillation methods in both transductive and production settings. Moreover, LLP
    achieves comparable or superior performance to teacher GNNs on 7 out of 8 datasets in the
    transductive setting. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of LLP on cold-start nodes, where
    it surpasses teacher GNNs and standalone MLPs by an average of <strong>25.29</strong> and <strong>9.42</strong> on Hits@20,
    respectively. Additionally, LLP exhibits significantly faster inference times compared to GNNs,
    such as being approximately <strong>70.68x</strong> faster on the large-scale <a>Collab</a> dataset.

    <b>Direct Distillation methods</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this work, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, we adopt the commonly used encoder-decoder framework
    for the link prediction task. The encoder learns node representations using GNNs or MLPs, and
    the MLP decoder predicts link existence probabilities. Initially, we applied two direct knowledge
    distillation methods: logit-matching and representation-matching (the gray arrows in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). In
    the logit-matching method, we generate the soft score for each candidate node pair with the
    teacher GNN model, and train the student to match the teacher’s prediction on each candidate.
    For the representation-matching, we align the student’s learned latent node embedding space
    with the teacher’s. However, empirical observations revealed that neither method was capable of
    distilling sufficient knowledge for the student model to perform well in link prediction tasks. We
    hypothesize that link prediction, unlike node classification, heavily relies on relational graph
    topological information, which is not effectively captured by direct distillation methods.

    <b>Relational Distillation Methods (LLP)</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    In accordance with our intuition regarding preservation of relational knowledge, we propose LLP,
    a relational distillation framework. Instead of focusing on matching individual node pair scores or
    node representations, LLP focuses on distilling knowledge about the relationships of each node
    (e.g., node 4 in <strong>Figure 1</strong>) to other nodes (referred as context nodes, e.g., nodes 1, 2, 5, 6 in 
    <strong>Figure 1</strong>) in the graph. We propose two relational matching objectives to achieve this goal: rank-based
    matching and distribution-based matching. The key components of LLP are introduced as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Context Nodes Sampling:</strong> For each anchor node, LLP samples some nearby nodes by
      repeating fixed-length random walks several times and randomly samples another few
      nodes from the whole graph to serve as the context nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rank-based Matching:</strong> LLP utilizes the ranking of the context nodes w.r.t. the anchor
      node induced by the teacher to teach the student.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Distribution-based Matching:</strong> LLP uses the KL divergence between the teacher
      predictions and student predictions, centered on each anchor node to train the student.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br/>

    <b>Effectiveness of LLP</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We evaluated LLP under various settings, including transductive, production (new nodes and
    edges appear during testing), and cold-start (testing nodes appear without edges) scenarios. The
    experimental results demonstrate that LLP consistently outperforms MLPs and the two direct
    distillation methods. Notably, as <strong>Table 2</strong> shown, LLP achieves superior performance compared to
    the teacher GNN model on 7 out of 8 datasets in the transductive setting.

    <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows that LLP not only improves performance but also offers significant speed
    improvements compared to GNNs and other inference acceleration methods. The experimental
    results show the efficiency gains achieved by LLP, reinforcing its practical applicability for large-
    scale link prediction tasks.

    <b>Conclusion</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    In this work, we address challenges related to deploying GNNs for link prediction at scale. By
    exploring cross-model distillation techniques from GNNs to MLPs, we introduce LLP as a novel
    framework that combines the strengths of both models. Our experiments demonstrated the
    effectiveness and efficiency of LLP in various settings. With LLP, we achieve improved
    performances as well as faster inference times, making it a promising solution for large-scale link
    prediction tasks that require both accuracy and efficiency. Our work provides valuable insights
    into developing effective knowledge distillation frameworks for GNNs and also serves as a new
    perspective for effective, efficient, and scalable link prediction.
