    Graph representation learning is a powerful tool with applications in a broad array of fields, including

    There has recently been a focus on graph self-supervised learning (SSL), which enables learning node
    representations without labels which are often difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. However,
    most of these suffer from one or more <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14394.pdf">key limitations</a>, including expensive <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04131">negative sampling steps</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02472">complex architectures</a>, and/or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06514">dataset-specific augmentations</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our recent work, titled <a class="can-line-break" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06936">“CARL-G: <strong>C</strong>lustering-<strong>A</strong>ccelerated <strong>R</strong>epresentation <strong>L</strong>earning on <strong>G</strong>raphs</a>,” we
    propose a novel graph representation learning method, CARL-G, that circumvents many of the above
    problems. This paper will appear at <a href="https://kdd.org/kdd2023/">KDD ‘23</a>, a top conference in data mining. Our results
    demonstrate that, when matched with the optimal clustering method and clustering-based loss
    function, CARL-G consistently outperforms alternatives. Specifically, it surpasses downstream node
    classification standards in <strong>4/5</strong> benchmark datasets while accelerating training by up to <strong>79</strong> times
    compared to the top-performing baseline. It is also on par with baselines in node clustering and
    similarity search tasks but is a whopping <strong>1,500</strong> times quicker in training than the top-performing (and
    slowest) baseline.

    <b>Cluster Validation Indices</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The core idea behind CARL-G is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning#Types">contrastive learning</a> (a recent advance in representation learning
    that has revolutionized how we learn representations without labels) often performs a similar task to
    clustering. Contrastive learning and clustering both pull positive samples closer together and push
    negative samples apart. However, contrastive learning has only become popular relatively recently,
    while clustering has had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">long history</a>, which has led to many developments, creating rich
    opportunities for transfer between the lines of work.
  </p>

  <p>
    One example of this is the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003132031200338X">well-studied</a> class of Clustering Validation Indices (CVIs), which are
    unsupervised estimators of cluster quality. These typically compare a ratio of intra-cluster to inter-
    cluster distance with the intuition that samples within the same cluster should be closer together, and
    those in different clusters should be further apart. A popular example of a CVI is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)">Silhouette score</a>.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <p class="sub-section">
    <b>Learning Representations with CVI-Inspired Loss Functions</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Our paper explores the novel idea of using a CVI as a loss function to optimize a neural network
    directly (in our case, a graph neural network, or GNN). A CVI requires two inputs: a set of samples and
    cluster assignments for each sample. In our case, the samples are node embeddings generated via a
    GNN encoder. Next, we can run a clustering algorithm (we find k-means works best) on the points to
    obtain a cluster embedding. We can then directly use a CVI as the loss function and backpropagate to
    update our GNN weights. We describe our architecture in more detail in the next section.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also show theoretical connections between a silhouette-based loss function and the commonly-
    used contrastive margin loss function. We prove that the silhouette-based loss is equivalent to the
    margin loss in both of their optimal cases (see paper for details). We also show that both are sensitive
    to different parameters - the effectiveness of silhouette-based losses depends on clustering error rate,
    while margin loss is sensitive to graph structure. This is notable, since adopting a different clustering
    algorithm to improve results on a given dataset is usually achievable, but changing the graph&#39;s
    structure is typically infeasible.

    <b>Architecture</b>

    <div class="caption"><b>Figure 1:</b> The general architecture of CARL-G. The choice of clustering 
      algorithm and loss function(CVI) are flexible.</div>  
  </div>
  <p>
    The input to CARL-G is a graph <strong>G</strong> with features for each node, represented by the feature matrix <strong>X</strong>. Our
    method aims to produce a set of embeddings <strong>H</strong> that can be used for various downstream tasks, like
    node clustering, similarity search, or node classification.
  </p>
  <p>
    As shown above in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, CARL-G consists of four steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Compute the embeddings <strong>H</strong> of the graph <strong>G</strong> using a GNN encoder.</li>
    <li>Compute the task-specific embeddings <strong>Z</strong> using an MLP encoder.</li>
    <li>Perform clustering (e.g., k-means) on <strong>Z</strong> to obtain a clustering <strong>C</strong>.</li>
    <li>Backpropagate using CVI-based loss (e.g., silhouette).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Once trained, we use <strong>H</strong> (the embeddings produced by the GNN encoder) for downstream tasks. It is
    worth noting that this framework works with different clustering methods and different CVIs. It is
    especially flexible as it allows for non-differentiable clustering methods (since no gradients flow
    through the clustering step).
  </p>
  <p>
    This allows us to avoid many of the limitations of existing methods. For instance, many current state-
    of-the-art methods require careful generation of augmentations (systematic and careful perturbations
    of data points that increase the diversity of training samples) and/or complex architectures consisting
    of multiple networks that have shared or exponentially averaged weights. Our method avoids these
    limitations with a simple architecture and without augmentations. Depending on the choice of CVI
    (e.g., the simplified silhouette), we may also reduce the cost of obtaining contrastive samples
    (compared to typical contrastive negative sampling) by working directly with cluster centroids instead
    of individual points.

    <b>Results</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Following existing work in the area, we evaluate CARL-G on three tasks: node classification, node
    clustering, and node similarity search. CARL-G outperforms the baselines on 4/5 datasets in node
    classification and is comparable with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02472">AF-GRL</a>, the best-performing baseline in the node clustering and
    similarity search tasks. Below, in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, we show a table of CARL-G’s strong node classification
    performance relative to other methods.

      compared to baselines across 5 datasets.</div>  
  </div>

  <p>
    However, the key advantage of CARL-G lies in its large efficiency improvements over existing methods.
    In <strong>Figure 3</strong>, we show CARL-G’s training time and GPU memory usage compared to other baseline
    methods. We can see that CARL-G is much more efficient than the baselines when using <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610927408827101">VRC</a> (Variance
    Ratio Criterion) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)#Simplified_Silhouette_and_Medoid_Silhouette">simplified silhouette</a>. These experiments are conducted on standard graph
    benchmark datasets in the full-batch setting, and we plan to run experiments on larger-scale datasets
    in the future. Please refer to our paper for more details.

    <b>Conclusion</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    SSL on graphs is still a nascent area, with many lines of exploration probing the best ways to learn
    general-purpose representations for downstream graph tasks. We present a new line of work
    demonstrating the value of using clustering and CVI-inspired loss functions to learn node
    representations. In particular, our proposed method, CARL-G, showcases an exciting advance toward
    accelerating and improving self-supervised graph representation learning. It is much faster (up to
    1,500x) while comparably accurate. Additionally, our work inspires several future lines of work: Are
    there CVIs or clustering methods which lead to better downstream representations? How does CARL-G
    fare on very large graphs in minibatch settings? We hope to explore these questions in the future. In
    the meantime, please check out our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06936">paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/willshiao/carl-g">code</a>, or poster in person at KDD!
